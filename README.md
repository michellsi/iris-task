# Bower Search Clone

A simple, responsive website which mimics the behaviour of https://bower.io/search/.
The site has a header section, a left sidebar, a footer and a content area.
The content area shows a list of modules with their name, latest release number & stars. This list is sortable
by name, latest release number & stars. It is possible to search for a specific module.
The search method uses the Bower search https://libraries.io/api/bower-search?q=jquery to query for modules.


# Toolset

I created a Rails app and used mainly HTML, CSS (SCSS) and JavaScript. As a UI framework I used Bootstrap.

# Deployment

I used Heroku to ship the website to production.
